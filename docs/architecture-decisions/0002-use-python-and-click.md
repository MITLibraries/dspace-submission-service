# 2. Use Python and Click

Date: 2021-08-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a language and framework to build an application that we have experience
deploying and maintaining in production.

## Decision

We will use Python and the Click framework.

## Consequences

We have more Python support across teams than other languages so choosing this
for a cross team project will allow for efficient development and maintenance.
